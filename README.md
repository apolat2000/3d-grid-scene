# 3d-grid-scene
A basic 3d grid scene I made for warming up for an internship.

## Get it running

Run `cd ./src && yarn install && yarn run dev`

## Controls

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Left click</kbd> to choose an object.
- <kbd>M</kbd> to move the chosen object to a grid unit.
- <kbd>R</kbd> to rotate the chosen object for Ï€/2 degrees.
- <kbd>Delete</kbd> to remove the chosen object from the scene and clean the allocated sources to it.
